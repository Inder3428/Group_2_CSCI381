                "The IN operator is used to find multiple values from a list or set matching one-to-many relationships, such as in a book made by multiple authors. The EXISTS operator, on the other hand, detects the presence or absence of a row, regardless of whether it returns a null value or not ie it will consider both null and non-null values of each row. EXISTS requires a subquery to function and can be used within correlated subqueries while the IN operator does not require subqueries but cannot be used within correlated subqueries. The EXISTS operator is generally more efficient as it only detects the existence of a row and stops evaluating once it finds at least one match returning faster results, unlike the IN operator which continues evaluating and comparing all values in the list."
